- add shadows
- levelset demo:
	- growth, erosion, boolean operations, multiple-levelsets and object segmentation, ensure a part (e.g. top opt result) has constant thickness (growth is proportional to error in desired value of level set?, or just set value of depest parts, and then reconstruct a signed distance field from that)
- bring back CDMC and model an animatronic figure with it
- get the discrete shell simulator as well
