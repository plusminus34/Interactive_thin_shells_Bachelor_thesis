Pick the app to run using main.txt
-- Start with AppXD 
New codebase uses CMake, so to add a new class, add the .h and .cpp files to
Apps/Plush in _Windows Explorer_ and then run runCMake.cmd
_Don't_ drag and drop into Visual Studio, it'll make everything wonky.
Otherwise good luck out there, 3D stuff is only semi-functional right now,
and the other apps (besides Loco, my current dev app) should work just fine.
