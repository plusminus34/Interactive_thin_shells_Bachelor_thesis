	//the other segment. Then a1b1.cd = 0 and a2b2.cd = 0. From these two equations with two unknowns, we need to get the mu_c and mu_d parameters
	//that will let us compute the points c and d. Of course, we need to make sure that they lie on the segments, or adjust the result if they don't.

	//unfortunately, there are quite a few cases we need to take care of. Here it is:

	double C = tmp2.dot(tmp2);
	double D = tmp3.dot(tmp3);
	double E = tmp1.dot(tmp3);

	if (IS_ZERO(C)){
		//current segment has 0 length
		return Segment(a, other.getClosestPointTo(this->a));

	if (IS_ZERO(D)){
		//other segment has 0 length
		return Segment(getClosestPointTo(other.a), other.a);
	}

	if (IS_ZERO(C*D - B*B)){
		//this means that the two segments are coplanar and parallel. In this case, there are
		//multiple segments that are perpendicular to the two segments (lines before the truncation really).

		//we need to get the projection of the other segment's end point on the current segment
		double mu_a2 = tmp1.dot(tmp2) / (tmp2.dot(tmp2));
		double mu_b2 = V3D(a, other.b).dot(tmp2) / (tmp2.dot(tmp2));

		//we are now interested in the parts of the segments that are in common between the two input segments
		boundToRange(&mu_a2, 0, 1);
		boundToRange(&mu_b2, 0, 1);

		//closest point on the current segment will lie at the midpoint of mu_a2 and mu_b2
		return Segment(this->a + tmp2 * ((mu_a2 + mu_b2) / 2.0), other.getClosestPointTo(this->a + tmp2 * ((mu_a2 + mu_b2) / 2.0)));

	//ok, now we'll find the general solution for two lines in space:
	double mu_c = (A*D - E*B) / (C*D-B*B);
	double mu_d = (mu_c*B - E) / D;

	//if the D point or the C point lie outside their respective segments, clamp the values
	boundToRange(&mu_c, 0, 1);
